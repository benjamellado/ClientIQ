# Project Renzo: AI-Assisted Client Management

## Introduction
Project Renzo aims to address the critical challenge of managing extensive client information within companies, particularly in the fintech sector. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, Renzo proposes a novel solution to streamline client data management and enhance internal communications.

## Problems Identified
- Difficulty in managing extensive client data and ensuring team-wide up-to-date knowledge.
- Key account updates are often siloed, leading to uninformed team decisions and development misalignments.
- Inconsistencies in internal language and terminology hinder the integration and effectiveness of AI tools within companies.

## Proposed Solution
Renzo introduces an AI assistant that centralizes client information, making it accessible and actionable through natural language queries and SQL queries. This solution combines LangChain, Q&A, and SQLAgents to provide comprehensive insights into client data.

### Key Features
- **Seamless Integration**: Minimizes the need for manual data input by automating data extraction and interpretation.
- **Comprehensive Client Insights**: Integrates reasoning and data-driven decisions to offer a full playbook of client information.
- **Adaptive Language**: Employs NLP to adapt to and replicate company-specific terminology, ensuring coherent communication.

## Progress to Date
- Developed methods for data extraction from documents using GPT and JSON schemas.
- Implemented Q&A functionalities with FAISS, RAG, and GPT for dynamic information retrieval.
- Created a database schema designed to accommodate extracted client data.
- Developed a SQLAgent capable of generating insights through direct data queries.

## Immediate Next Steps
- Adapt the system for Spanish language support.
- Integrate document retrieval, Q&A functionalities, and SQLAgent into a unified workflow.
- Explore integration with document storage systems (e.g., Notion) and existing databases.
- Develop a business persona with a specific Latin identity.

## Challenges & Help Needed
- **Data Acquisition**: Seeking sources to enrich and validate the concept.
- **Company Language Learning**: Strategies for enabling the bot to learn and adapt to company-specific language without extensive fine-tuning.
- **Implementation**: Advice on product implementation and user and data integration for potential clients.

## Future Directions
- Explore RAT for enhanced contextual reasoning and complex problem-solving capabilities.
- Consider developing a simplified version for internal knowledge base applications, potentially expanding to a suite of specialized chatbots.
- Addressing concern of privacy of information by creating users within the bot.
- Including a built-in feedback loop where users can report issues or suggest improvements could be valuable for continuous development and user satisfaction.

## Conclusion
Project Renzo represents a groundbreaking step towards intelligent, intuitive client management solutions. By addressing the nuanced needs of fintech companies, Renzo aims to revolutionize how businesses interact with and manage client data.
